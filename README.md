Implementation of SIP protocol

========================================

Implement a simplified version of the SIP protocol to set up a session, an audio stream for conversation, 
between two hosts. We assume that one of the participants, A, always is the one who initiates and ends a 
session. B is waiting for, but never initiates to, a session.
